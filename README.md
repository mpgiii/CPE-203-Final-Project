This is the final project for CPE 203 at Cal Poly with Professor Hatalsky. It was a quarter long project with five parts.
1. Move all static methods into classes that they fit better in.
2. Create interfaces for logical groupings of similar or identical code.
3. Create abstract classes for more connected and streamlined code, allowing for less repetition of code.
4. Create a pathing strategy using a strategy design pattern, and then implement the A* algorithm for pathing.
5. Modify the game to support a world-changing event on a mouse click, including a new entity and modified behavior of exisiting entities.

This project was also my first experience in Java.
