1. How To Trigger The Event
    A mouse click will cause a blizzard to occur so quickly that the user can't see it. After the blizzard abruptly ends, a square of snow will be left around where the mouse click occurred and a snowman will spawn at the point the mouse was clicked.

2. What Should Happen When The Event Is Triggered
    A square of snow should appear around where the user clicked. The closest miner will be turned into a Cold Miner, which will be described in part 3. Inside of the snow patch, a snowman is spawned, which will be described in part 4.

3. What The Affected Entities Should Do
    The affected entity is the closest miner to the event. This miner will (obviously) get cold because it was so close to a blizzard that caused a snow patch to appear in their world. Because it is cold, it will animate at one tenth the speed as a normal miner would. It will move in place until it has warmed, which is after a set amount of time.

4. What The New Entity Is And How It Should Behave
    The new entity is a snowman. The snowman will go towards the nearest blacksmith and freeze it. It also will leave a trail of snow in its path. However, because it is sunny, it can only move 25 spaces before it melts and disappears.
